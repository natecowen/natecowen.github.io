        <p>I first began writing HTML and CSS when I was in college. It was 2006 when typed my first line of code, most likely the all too familiar “hello world”. At the time, I was simply trying to understand the mythical beast known as code. I had always been in awe of people who could program. It seemed that they had the potential to create worlds; worlds that were only limited by their own creativity and imagination. I was envious of friends who knew how to program. Ultimately, this is what lead me to take my first coding class in HTML.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months and everyone I knew was talking about something called a CMS or Content Management System. It seemed that everyone I knew had heard of this term and everyone had experience with it. My first experience with a CMS came from a class mate that needed help with a few of his clients. He approached me and asked if I would be willing to help update a few sites with new content several times a week. Being very comfortable with HTML and CSS, I was happy to help. Initially, this freelance was a combination of HTML and CMS work, but soon it started to include modifying PHP code that controlled layouts and basic functionality. </p>
<p>After many attempts I could usually find and modify the code that needed updating. However, every bit of programming I had to do made my brain hurt and left me feeling massively overwhelmed. I simply didn’t understand how to program. It wasn’t until years later that I truly learned how to program. The thing is… I still get this feeling all of the time. This constant nagging that I’ll never know enough or never be as good as so and so. </p>
<p>Despite these feelings, I’ve realized that programming is constantly changing. It’s something I have grown to accept. I know that there will always be some new technology or some new trend. It’s part of the reason I am starting this site. I see this site as a testing ground for my thoughts, ideas, and general lack of knowledge. I see this site as an opportunity to learn new (new to me) technologies and to improve my overal skillset. That is why I have chosen to use github and a static site generator <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">(hexo)</a>. </p>
